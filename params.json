I became amazed of how we are be able to retell stories through photographs and also how we can create images that shares what our eyes as photographers can see. From then on, I started to love taking pictures and share what my eyes can see to the world. This is so that we can either relive the moment, take hold of the time or take a second to ponder on what we can uncover through the images.\"* \r\n\r\n<body>\r\n----------------------------------------------------\r\n**contact her through her social media accounts** \r\nwww.facebook.com/ymgaf | @megforteza(Twitter) | @megforteza(Instagram)  \r\n\r\n**or email her at**  \r\nforteza.mg@gmail.com | maforteza@up.edu.ph \r\n***","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
